<h1>Network Analysis of the Post-Soviet Region</h1>
<h3>
States form military alliances to strengthen their security from potential threats or conflicts. They build an interconnected military alliance network and link through a complex web of relations. However, conflicts can alter these connections and impair alliance structures. I examine the effects of conflicts on alliance structures by focusing on the post-Soviet region. Conducting a network analysis based on the temporal exponential random graph model (TERGM), I found that conflicts, such as Russo-Georgian War in 2008, the Annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014 and the Nagorno Karabakh war in 2020 had debilitating effects on the alliance structures of the post-Soviet region. In addition to conflicts the empirical analysis revealed that the presence of Russian bases in some of the post-Soviet states also decreased the likelihood of alliance formation.</h3>
