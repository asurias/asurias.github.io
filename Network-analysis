          <h5>States form military alliances to strengthen their security from potential threats. 
		  They build an interconnected military alliance network and link through a complex web of relations. 
		But conflicts can alter these connections and impair alliance structures.   <br><br>
		  To analyze the impact of conflicts on alliance networks, I examine the post-Soviet region. <br><br>
		  
		  
		  Based on the temporal exponential random graph model (TERGM), I conduct a network analysis of post-Soviet alliance 
		  structures, considering the impact of three conflicts:  
		 the Russo-Georgian War in 2008, the Annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014, and the Nagorno Karabakh War in 2020. 
		 </h5><br><br><p>Post-Soviet Alliances 2008-2020</p>
		 <img src="assets/img/alliances.png" class="img-fluid" alt=""><br>
        <br></div>
		<h5>TERGM's enable probability assessment of the observed network compared to any possible permutation 
		of alliances in an alternative network. It considers the same number of nodes based on the statistics of the network. 
		The model measures the dependencies of the network as well as the covariates at the dyadic level. 
		It uses bootstrap maximum pseudolikelihood estimation, which was developed by Desmarais and Cranmer (2012) for unbiased simulation studies.  
		</h5>
		<br><br><h4>TERGM's are build on Exponential Random Graph Models</h4><br><br>
		<h5>The fundamental structures, which produce network effects, have been referred to as “k-stars” 
		in the network literature. In its basic form, the k-star occurs as a 2-star when a dyad, or in this case, state i, shares a tie or is allied to states j and h.</h5>
		 <img src="assets/img/kst.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="">
		 <h5>For instance, an alliance network is formed when Russia is allied with Belarus and Pakistan, but Pakistan and Belarus are not allied with one another. Similarly, a 3-star is formed if state i is connected to states j, h, and l, yet the last three states do not share any links. </h5>
		 <br>
		 <br>
		 <h5>k-stars are included in the structural statistics of Exponential Random Graph Models. The statistics of k-starts are expressed in the following equation:</h5>
		 <img src="assets/img/kstar.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">
		 <h5>Where + sign suggests the summation of all i (Snijder et al. 2006). Essentially the star equation counts 
		 the number of k-stars that are present in the observed network to then use the number in the estimation process 
		 by putting greater weights on simulated networks which have similar or the same amount of k-stars.<br><br>
		In essence, k-stars can capture “preferential attachments” or “popularity effects” in network structures. 
		In the post-Soviet network, k-stars can capture the patterns of multiple states allying with the same state.
		<br><br><br><h5>
		The next endogenous structure I considered was triangles. 
		Triangles can be seen as the continuation of k-stars in network structures. 
		Two nodes were  considered more likely to ally if they were both linked to the same node. 
		The network literature refers to this phenomenon as “triangle closure”:
		 </h5>
		  <img src="assets/img/triangle.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">
		 <br>
		 <h5>In addition to these endogenous network structures, the three conflicts mentioned above, a number of independent variables were also accounted for.
			These included: 
		 </h5><br>
		<h5> <ul>
		  <li>Direct Contiguity</li>
		  <li>State Capabilities - Composite index of national capabilities (CINC)</li>
 		 <li>Russian Bases Abroad</li>
 		 <li>Trade Dependency (GDP, Export, Import and Energy)</li>
		  <li>Political Compatibility - Freedom House Democracy Index, the BTI Political Transformation Index and the UN the Human Development Index</li>
		</ul></h5> <br><br>
		<h4>The Results</h4><br>
		 <img src="assets/img/results.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="">
		 <br><br>
		 <h5>The model estimated the post-Soviet alliance network at three points in time – 2008, 2014, and 2020 - 
		 to capture the effects of interstate conflicts on the state ties or edges. Based on the history of the 
		 Russo-Georgian War in 2008, the Annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014 and the Nagorno Karabakh war in 2020, 
		 the model predicted the probability of new allinaces. The results in bold are statistically significant.  
		 </h5><br><br>
		 <h5>Conceptualizing alliance formation as a complex network enables the measurement of falsifiable and precise 
		dependencies in an alliance system. Suggesting that interstate conflicts decrease the likelihood of forming alliance ties, the analysis confirmed that 
		conflicts produced debilitating effects and reduced the probability of alliance formation in the regional post-Soviet network. 
		<br><br> 
		Additionally, I measured the endogenous network structures of the post-Soviet region and found that 'synergy' effects positively 
		impacted edge formation. The prospect of allying with states that already share a connection increases the utility of an alliance 
		 and makes it more advantageous. </h5>
